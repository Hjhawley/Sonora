Progress Checkpoint 1
Agenda

- Current state: a working GUI prototype can scan folders, find .mp3s, read ID3 metadata, and display Track/Album views with an inspector. Edits can be made in memory only, not written to files.

- Demo

- Right on track with my schedule:
	Repo + architecture outline
	Working Iced GUI window
	Folder import + scan
	ID3 tag reading from files

- Still need to thoroughly test:
	Different filetypes
	Recursive scan
	Should start writing some Unit tests

- Current structure:
	/core = scanning, ID3 tag reading, data types
	/gui = handle frontend stuff to keep main.rs lean

- Difficulties
	Rust/Iced learning curve, heavily relying on ChatGPT to teach me what does what
	Ex: why are 'column' and 'Column' two different objects? (one is the actual class and one is a function that builds the object)

- Potential challenges
	Remains to be seen how this will scale with large library sizes

- Next steps
	Single & batch file editing
	Playback
	If time permits, prettier GUI (low priority)

- Questions
	What would you like to see in an app like this, as a fellow music enthusiast?
